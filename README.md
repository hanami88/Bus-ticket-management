## Bus Ticket Management

### Background and Problem

Currently, bus ticket booking still relies heavily on manual methods such as phone calls or purchasing tickets directly at ticket counters, which causes many inconveniences.

**From the customer’s perspective:**
- Difficulty in searching for route information and schedules  
- Hard to compare ticket prices between different bus operators  
- Time-consuming travel and long waiting times at ticket offices  

**From the bus operator’s perspective:**
- Complicated ticket management processes  
- Difficulty in tracking passenger numbers  
- Challenges in revenue reporting and statistics  
- High risk of human errors  

The development of an online bus ticket booking system is an optimal solution to address these issues, aligning with the digital transformation trend and significantly improving user experience.
